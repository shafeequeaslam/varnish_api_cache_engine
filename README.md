# Varnish API Cache engine
API Cache Solution with Varnish 4.0
##Requirements
             * API Backend
             * Varnish
             * Cloudflare or cloudfront (Optional: Only if ssl termination for API's is needed)
###Note: Varnish will not support SSL in both end, So make backend available without SSL
